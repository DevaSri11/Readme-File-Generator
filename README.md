# README Generator | Professional GitHub Documentation Suite

Generate high-quality, technically accurate, and narrative-driven GitHub documentation in seconds. This tool uses advanced AI to analyze project descriptions or existing repositories to produce professional READMEs and resume impact statements.

## Project Overview
The **README Generator** is a specialized tool designed for developers and students who want to showcase their technical work with high-end documentation. By leveraging the **Groq Llama-3.3-70B** model, it goes beyond generic templates to create meaningful stories around code, highlighting the problem, the core concepts, and the technical implementation details.

## The Problem
Many developers create amazing projects but struggle to explain them in a way that resonates with recruiters or other engineers. Often:
- Documentation is an afterthought or feels "generic."
- Technical stack details are missed or poorly explained.
- Students find it difficult to translate their projects into impact-driven resume bullet points.

**Goal:** To automate the creation of high-quality, recruiter-friendly documentation that accurately reflects a developer's technical prowess.

## How it Works
The system operates on a "Technical Storyteller" logic, which follows a clear narrative flow:
**Problem → Domain Concept → Solution → Technical System → Professional Impact.**

### Key Features
<ul>
    <li><b>GitHub Repository Analysis:</b> Fetches file structures, language distributions, and existing content via the GitHub REST API.</li>
    <li><b>Narrative-Driven Generation:</b> Dynamically adapts headings (e.g., "What is Churn?") based on the project's domain.</li>
    <li><b>Resume Project Section:</b> Generates 2-3 impact-driven bullet points and a technology-rich header for immediate inclusion in a professional resume.</li>
    <li><b>Intelligent Caching:</b> Uses Streamlit caching to prevent redundant API calls, saving tokens and providing instant results for repeated queries.</li>
    <li><b>Dual Mode Output:</b> Provides both a live "Preview" (rendered markdown) and a "Code Source" view for easy copying.</li>
</ul>

## Technical Architecture
Built with a modern Python stack focused on performance and interactivity:
- **UI Framework:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for a premium, glassmorphism-inspired interface.
- **LLM Engine:** [Groq API](https://groq.com/) (using `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) for lightning-fast text generation.
- **Data Fetching:** [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) for asynchronous-ready communication with the GitHub API.
- **Environment Management:** [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) for secure API key handling.

## Project Structure
```text
README Generator/
├── app.py              # Main Streamlit application and AI logic
├── .env                # API Key and environmental configurations (ignored)
├── requirements.txt    # Project dependencies
└── README.md           # You are here!
```

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/readme-generator.git
   cd readme-generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Groq API Key:
   ```text
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python -m streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Support for private GitHub repositories via OAuth.
- Inclusion of automated screenshot/media generation for the "Preview" section.
- Multi-model support (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet).
